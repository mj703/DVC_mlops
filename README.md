# DVC MLOps Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of DVC (Data Version Control) for MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) on GitHub. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how DVC can be used to track changes to data and models in a machine learning project, and how it can be integrated with GitHub to enable collaboration among team members.

# DVC in MLOps

DVC (Data Version Control) is a tool that can be used in MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) to track changes to data and models in a machine learning project. DVC works by creating a Git-like repository of data and model files, allowing you to easily track changes and collaborate with team members.

## Benefits of using DVC in MLOps

- Version control for data and models: DVC allows you to version control your data and models, just like you version control your code with Git. This makes it easy to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with team members.

- Reproducibility: With DVC, you can easily reproduce experiments by tracking the data and models used in each experiment. This makes it easy to reproduce results and compare the performance of different models.

- Efficient storage: DVC uses Git-like techniques to store only the changes to your data and models, rather than storing full copies of each file. This means that you can store large datasets and models without consuming too much disk space.

- Integration with other tools: DVC can be integrated with other MLOps tools, such as MLflow and Kubeflow, to create an end-to-end machine learning pipeline.

- Collaboration: DVC allows multiple team members to work on the same data and models, with changes tracked and merged using Git. This makes it easy to collaborate on machine learning projects and ensure that everyone is working with the latest data and models.

Overall, DVC is a powerful tool that can help you manage data and models in your machine learning projects, making them more reproducible and easier to collaborate on.
